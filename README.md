# Jerald Tan's Portfolio
## Project Assessment: Frontend User Development

### UX: 
This web portfolio is primarily designed for potential employers/recruiters looking for software engineers in order to find employment after graduation from the bootcamp. 
Simple contrasting colors with soft background tones reduces noise for them to navigate. 
I also provided an easy access to linkedin, github and a downloadable resume for recruiters to quickly find out more.
My professional attributes which employers are looking at the most for a software development job 
are highlighted: about(self-portrait), tech skills, projects, education. 
The portfolio's secondary objective is to increase accessiblity and online presence for networking and collaboration purposes. 


### Business Goal: 
Find a software development job and open up collaboration opportunities.
### User Goal: 
Find a potential candidate for their own company/client.

### Features:

2) Icon-panel: fixed panel quick option to easily access linkedin profile, github respositories and a downloadable version of resume at any time.
3) Animated tech skills section: most important part of the portfolio.
4) Scrollspy for 'about me' section: Information about myself that will make me unique and stand out from other candidates - touching on my overseas experience and personal goals. media responsive, visually lengthy text for ipad devices and smaller. Used a overflow box to reduce scrolling time for users on mobile devices. 
5) Project-accordion: interactive design to showcase coursework and side projects allowing for drop downs and hide functionality to prevent clutter.
