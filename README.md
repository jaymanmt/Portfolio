Testing: 
**As the main user story is to increase speed for accessing information as well as an eye-catching patterns and images to keep them interested.
**As the ideal job is a software developer, employers will most likely be critical of webpage design and its content, thus further emphaisising the need for a range of QA testing.
1) Mobile Responsiveness: the project is constructed with a mobile-first design. it was tested and adjusted for iPhone sizes, iPad, and desktop versions on Google Chrome and Firefox, to prevent overlay or breaking of elements. 
2) Color Schemes: tested and chose a mix of black and grey to showcase information layers and dark orange+lightblue which are harmonious with each other to highlight prioritized information., grey, blue, with not more than 3 similar shades on content and 1 contrasting color of the headings. 
3) Tested all links to ensure they are working as intended. 
4) General QA: fixed background attachments, fixed icon-panel, edited bootstrap components, hover styling, standardisation of font-family.
