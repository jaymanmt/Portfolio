Testing: 
**As the main user story is to increase speed for accessing information as well as an eye-catching patterns and images to keep them interested.
**As the ideal job is a software developer, employers will most likely be critical of webpage design and its content, thus further emphaisising the need for a range of QA testing.
1) Mobile Responsiveness: the project is constructed with a mobile-first design. it was tested and adjusted for iPhone sizes, iPad, and desktop versions on Google Chrome and Firefox, to prevent overlay or breaking of elements. 
2) Color Schemes: tested and chose a mix of white and grey spaces to showcase information sections and dark orange+lightblue which are harmonious with each other to highlight prioritized information., grey, blue, with not more than 3 similar shades on content and 1 contrasting color of the headings. 
3) Tested all links to ensure they are working as intended. 
4) General QA: fixed background attachments, fixed icon-panel, edited bootstrap components, hover styling, standardisation of font-family. 
5) Text-alignments are all from the left to promote consistency of information and better portray the relatively high amounts of words in certain sections.
6) Section alignnments are centralised in mobile devices, but on desktop, its stems from the left with symmetry coming from the technical skill progress bars and the contact me form.
